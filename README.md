# DEARPYGUI VS TKINTER


<br/>

Both are Python libraries that can be used to create interactive Graphical User Interfaces
in Python. 

<br/> 

> In this project we highlight some of the differences between them, especially how 
DearPyGui simplifies alot of the GUI creation process. 

In this project we created a Horoscope App. You enter your day, month and year of birth
and we return your zodiac sign, an image of your zodiac sign and your horoscope. 

This is pulled from static content in the resources directory.

The DearPyGui frontend can be found in the dpg directory and the tkinter frontend can be found in the
tkinter directory.
